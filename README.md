- 🔭 I’m currently participating in a fullstack development bootcamp and I'm working hard on some good personal projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning PHP and Laravel. I can already work with JS, Bootstrap and VUE. 
- 😄 About me: I like to work in different projects at the same time, I love ❤️ to read about and work on education and personal and professional growth and I am constantly studying and learning new stuff. 
- ⚡ In the future, I would like to work on my own education tool project. 
- 🤔 Extra- although not very useful- info: I love doing creative activities, so I sing, I write and I do handcrafts. I guess that's the reason why I like frontEnd so much.
